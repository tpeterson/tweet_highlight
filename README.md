#Tweet Highlight

###Chrome browser extension to tweet selected text from a web page.

---

Sometimes I want to tweet a link to an article, but I don't want to draft my own
thing to say about the article or a line in the article stands out.
Copy-and-pasting is fine. But it's not as fast as selecting the text, clicking a
button and having the tweet automatically populated with that text and the URL
of the article. So that's what this Chrome extension does.
